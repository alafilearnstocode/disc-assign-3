The repo contains a Followers Page design with a user-focused layout. At the top, the header prominently displays the user name centered for clarity. A back button is positioned on the left.

Beneath the header, the page features navigation tabs that organize content into three categories: “Users you know,” “Followers,” and “Following.” The active tab, “Users you know,” is underlined to help users quickly identify their current view. 

The main content is a user list, where each user card includes essential details. These cards feature a circular placeholder for profile pictures, alongside the user’s name, handle, and a concise description. To encourage interaction, each card incorporates a “Follow” button with rounded corners and a dark background.
